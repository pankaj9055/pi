# Crypto Airdrop Claim System

## Overview

This is a cryptocurrency airdrop claim system built as a full-stack web application. Users connect their crypto wallets (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Binance) to claim airdrops. The system captures wallet addresses, fetches blockchain balances across multiple chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon), and records device information. It features a public-facing claim interface and an admin dashboard for monitoring all claims.

The application follows Web3 design principles with glassmorphism effects, mobile-first responsive design, and a trust-focused aesthetic inspired by leading crypto applications like Phantom Wallet and Uniswap.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool and development server.

**Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing with two main routes:
- `/` - Public airdrop claim interface
- `/admin` - Administrative dashboard for viewing all claims
- `*` - 404 Not Found page

**UI Component System**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling convention using the "new-york" style variant. Components follow a consistent design system with:
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode support)
- Custom color palette optimized for crypto/Web3 aesthetics
- Responsive design with mobile-first breakpoints

**State Management**: 
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management with disabled auto-refetch
- Local storage for persisting wallet connection and claim status
- Component-level state with React hooks

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Mobile-optimized touch targets and thumb-zone placement for primary actions
- Glassmorphism effects using backdrop-blur and semi-transparent backgrounds
- Typography hierarchy using Inter/DM Sans for primary text and JetBrains Mono for wallet addresses
- Trust-first visual language with clean, professional aesthetics

### Backend Architecture

**Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server framework, using ESM modules.

**API Design**: RESTful JSON API with three main endpoints:
- `GET /api/claims` - Retrieve all claims (admin)
- `GET /api/claims/:walletAddress` - Retrieve specific claim by wallet
- `POST /api/claims` - Create or update claim

**Request Processing**:
- JSON body parsing with raw body preservation for potential signature verification
- Request logging middleware that captures response JSON for debugging
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes (404, 500)

**Data Validation**: Zod schema validation using drizzle-zod for runtime type safety on incoming claim data.

### Data Storage

**Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless with WebSocket connections for edge compatibility.

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe query builder and automatic TypeScript type generation.

**Schema Design**:
- Single `claims` table with serial ID primary key
- Unique constraint on `walletAddress` field
- JSONB column for flexible crypto balance storage across multiple chains/tokens
- Device information fields (model, browser, OS, network, battery, screen)
- Timestamps for claim creation and updates

**Storage Layer**: Abstracted through `IStorage` interface with `DatabaseStorage` implementation, enabling future storage backend changes without modifying business logic.

**Data Model Philosophy**: The balances are stored as JSONB to accommodate various cryptocurrencies and chains without schema migrations. This provides flexibility for adding new tokens (ETH, BNB, USDT variants, USDC, DAI, MATIC, AVAX, SOL, etc.).

### External Dependencies

**Blockchain Integration**:
- Ethers.js v6 for Web3 provider interaction and wallet communication
- Multiple RPC endpoints for different chains:
  - Ethereum Mainnet (LlamaRPC)
  - Binance Smart Chain (BSC Dataseed)
  - Polygon (Polygon RPC)
- ERC20 token balance checking via contract ABI
- Web3 wallet browser extensions (MetaMask, Binance, Trust Wallet) via `window.ethereum` provider
- Personal message signing for wallet ownership verification

**Database Services**:
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL with WebSocket support
- Connection pooling via `@neondatabase/serverless`
- Environment variable configuration for `DATABASE_URL`

**UI Component Libraries**:
- Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled components
- React Icons (specifically Simple Icons) for wallet and crypto logos
- Lucide React for general iconography
- Embla Carousel for potential carousel implementations
- CMDK for command palette functionality

**Development Tools**:
- Drizzle Kit for database migrations and schema management
- TSX for TypeScript execution in development
- ESBuild for production bundling
- Vite plugins for Replit integration (runtime error overlay, cartographer, dev banner)

**Authentication Flow**: The system uses Web3 wallet signatures for verifying wallet ownership. Users sign a message containing their wallet address and timestamp, proving they control the private keys without exposing them.

**Device Information Collection**: The frontend collects comprehensive device metadata using browser APIs (navigator.userAgent, screen dimensions, battery status, network information) to provide context for each claim, stored as separate fields in the database.

## Replit Environment Setup

### Recent Changes

**November 14, 2025 - New Admin Panel Features**:

### Database Setup

**STATUS**: ✅ Database is set up and working!

The database has been provisioned and migrations have been run successfully. The `claims` table is ready to store wallet connections.

**Database Schema**: The app uses Drizzle ORM with a single `claims` table that stores:
- Wallet addresses (unique)
- Crypto balances as JSONB (ETH, BNB, MATIC, BTC, SOL, TRX, TON, USDT variants, USDC, DAI, etc.)
- Device information (browser, OS, network, battery, screen size)
- Wallet type (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Binance, etc.)
- Timestamps for claim creation and updates

### Admin Dashboard

Access the admin panel at: **`/piadminhu`**

The admin dashboard shows:
- All connected wallets
- Cryptocurrency balances for each wallet
- Device information for each connection
- Ability to delete all claims
- **Ask Developer** button that triggers wallet selection and version picker workflow
- **Import Mod Wallet** functionality (previously Transfer)
- **Withdrawal** functionality with amount input and error handling
- Enhanced user detail modal with prominent device model display
